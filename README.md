# FrogSpawn

A toolbox for quantitative morphometric analysis of early development in spherical embryos, such as Xenopus laevis (African Clawed Frog). The toolbox was originally developed for Matlab 6.5 and higher and combines C-Mex code with Matlab functions and was originally hosted on SourceForge (https://sourceforge.net/projects/frogspawn).

FrogSpawn tools were used for the following publications:

Wallingford, “Regional requirements for Dishevelled signaling during Xenopus gastrulation: separable effects on blastopore closure, mesendoderm internalization and archenteron formation,” Development, vol. 131, no. 24, pp. 6195–6209, Dec. 2004 [Online].
