# FrogSpawn

A toolbox for quantitative morphometric analysis of early development in spherical embryos, such as Xenopus laevis (African Clawed Frog). The toolbox was originally developed for Matlab 6.5 and higher and combines C-Mex code with Matlab functions.

This software package was originally released on SourceForge (https://sourceforge.net), but is re-released here on GitHub under a more permissive MIT license.
